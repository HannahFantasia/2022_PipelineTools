A small toolkit to reduce headaches within your independent filmmaking pipeline.

Big thanks to Sas van Gulik, my mentor who helped me learn the basics of Python and figured out how to parse the XML.


Installation is done by taking the folders in the root files, turning them into .zip files and importing them in Krita through:

`tools>scripts>import python plugin from file.`

These tools don't have their own buttons but they are in the `tools>scripts` tab
